# Notifications

Rune includes a comprehensive notification system that helps you stay aware of important work-life balance events without being intrusive.

## Features

The notification system supports several types of notifications:

- **Break Reminders**: Gentle reminders to take breaks during long work sessions
- **End-of-Day Reminders**: Notifications when you've reached your target work hours or when it's time to wrap up
- **Session Complete**: Confirmations when you finish a work session
- **Idle Detection**: Alerts when you've been idle for an extended period
- **Custom Notifications**: Support for custom notification types

## Platform Support

Notifications are supported on:

- **macOS**: Uses `osascript` for native notification center integration
- **Linux**: Uses `notify-send` for desktop environment notifications
- **Windows**: Uses PowerShell and Windows Toast notifications

## Configuration

Notifications can be configured in your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
settings:
  notifications:
    enabled: true                    # Enable/disable all notifications
    break_reminders: true           # Break reminder notifications
    end_of_day_reminders: true      # End-of-day notifications
    session_complete: true          # Session completion notifications
    idle_detection: true            # Idle detection notifications
    sound: true                     # Enable notification sounds
```

## Testing Notifications

You can test your notification setup using the built-in test command:

```bash
# Test all notification types
rune test notifications

# Test DND integration
rune test dnd
```

## Notification Types

### Break Reminders

Sent when you've been working continuously for your configured break interval:

- **Title**: "ðŸ§˜ Time for a Break"
- **Message**: Shows how long you've been working and suggests taking a break
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Sound**: Yes (if enabled)

### End-of-Day Reminders

Sent when you approach or exceed your target work hours:

- **Title**: "ðŸŒ… End of Workday"
- **Message**: Shows total work time and remaining time to target (if applicable)
- **Priority**: High
- **Sound**: Yes (if enabled)

### Session Complete

Sent when you stop a work session:

- **Title**: "âœ… Session Complete"
- **Message**: Shows session duration and project name
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Sound**: No

### Idle Detection

Sent when you've been idle for an extended period:

- **Title**: "ðŸ’¤ Idle Time Detected"
- **Message**: Shows idle duration and asks if session should be paused
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Sound**: No

## Integration with Do Not Disturb

The notification system is integrated with Rune's DND functionality:

- Notifications respect your system's Do Not Disturb settings
- Rune can automatically enable DND when starting work sessions
- Break and end-of-day notifications can still appear even when DND is enabled (depending on your system settings)

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing

1. **Check system permissions**: Ensure Rune has permission to send notifications
2. **Verify configuration**: Make sure notifications are enabled in your config
3. **Test the system**: Run `rune test notifications` to verify functionality
4. **Check DND settings**: Ensure your system's Do Not Disturb isn't blocking notifications

### macOS Specific Issues

- Grant notification permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Notifications
- If using Terminal, ensure Terminal has notification permissions

### Linux Specific Issues

- Ensure `notify-send` is installed: `sudo apt install libnotify-bin` (Ubuntu/Debian)
- Check your desktop environment's notification settings

### Windows Specific Issues

- Ensure Windows notifications are enabled in Settings > System > Notifications & actions
- PowerShell execution policy may need to be adjusted

## Privacy

Rune's notification system:

- Only sends notifications locally to your system
- Does not transmit any data over the network
- Respects your system's notification and privacy settings
- Can be completely disabled if not needed

## Examples

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
settings:
  notifications:
    enabled: true
    break_reminders: true
    end_of_day_reminders: true
    session_complete: false  # Disable if too noisy
    idle_detection: true
    sound: false  # Quiet notifications
```

### Developer-Focused Configuration

```yaml
settings:
  notifications:
    enabled: true
    break_reminders: true      # Important for health
    end_of_day_reminders: true # Work-life balance
    session_complete: false    # Can be distracting
    idle_detection: true       # Helpful for time tracking
    sound: false              # Maintain focus
```

### Minimal Configuration

```yaml
settings:
  notifications:
    enabled: true
    break_reminders: false
    end_of_day_reminders: true  # Only end-of-day reminders
    session_complete: false
    idle_detection: false
    sound: false
