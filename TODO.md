## Notes

### Development Principles
- **Security First**: All features must pass security review
- **User Privacy**: No telemetry without explicit opt-in
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-200ms startup time
- **Accessibility**: CLI must work with screen readers
- **Cross-Platform**: Support macOS, Linux, Windows equally

### Architecture Decisions
- **Language**: Go 1.21+ for performance and cross-platform support
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra for command structure
- **Configuration**: Viper for YAML parsing
- **Storage**: BoltDB for local state management
- **Testing**: Go testing + Testify for comprehensive coverage

### Release Strategy
- **MVP Target**: 3 months from start
- **Beta Release**: Limited to 100 developers
- **Public Launch**: Open source release with community features
- **Enterprise**: 6 months post-MVP with team features
