# Product Requirements Document: Rune CLI

**Version:** 2.1  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Executive Summary

Rune is a developer-first CLI productivity platform that automates daily work rituals, enforces healthy work-life boundaries, and integrates seamlessly with existing developer workflows. By combining time tracking, workflow automation, and focus protection in a single tool, we address the fragmented landscape of developer productivity tools while promoting sustainable work practices.

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Vision

To become the essential productivity companion for developers, transforming how they start, manage, and end their workday through intelligent automation and mindful boundary setting.

### 1.2 Mission

Empower developers to build sustainable work habits by providing a unified, extensible platform that automates repetitive tasks, protects focus time, and creates clear work-life boundaries.

### 1.3 Product Name

**Rune** - A mystical approach to ritual automation, where developers “cast” their daily work spells.

### 1.4 Problem Statement

Developers currently juggle multiple disconnected tools for time tracking, task automation, and focus management. The blurred boundaries between work and personal time lead to burnout, while repetitive setup tasks reduce productive hours. There is no unified solution that addresses these interconnected challenges.

### 1.5 Target Audience

**Primary:** Individual developers and technical professionals who:

- Use CLI tools as part of their daily workflow
- Work remotely or in hybrid environments
- Value automation and efficiency
- Struggle with work-life balance

**Secondary:** Development teams seeking:

- Standardized onboarding processes
- Shared workflow configurations
- Team productivity insights

## 2. Market Analysis

### 2.1 Market Opportunity

- **67%** of developers prioritize work-life balance
- **70%** struggle with time management
- **42%** work remotely full-time
- **88%** of DevOps tools use YAML configuration

### 2.2 Competitive Landscape

|Tool       |Category       |Strengths                   |Weaknesses               |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
|Watson     |Time Tracking  |Simple CLI, project tracking|No automation, no DND    |
|Timewarrior|Time Tracking  |Powerful reporting          |Complex setup, no rituals|
|dijo       |Habit Tracking |Great UX, scriptable        |No time tracking         |
|TaskWarrior|Task Management|Feature-rich                |Steep learning curve     |

**Key Differentiator:** No existing tool combines time tracking + ritual automation + work-life balance features in a developer-native CLI interface.
