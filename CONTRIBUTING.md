- **Be collaborative**: Work together to build something amazing
- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and suggestions
- **Be patient**: Remember that everyone is learning

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+**: Primary development language
- **Git**: Version control
- **Make**: Build automation
- **Docker**: For testing cross-platform builds (optional)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rune.git
   cd rune
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Build and Test**
   ```bash
   make build
   make test
   ```

4. **Run Development Version**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow the guidelines in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Key points:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Security-First**: Validate all inputs, use secure defaults
- **Code Simplicity**: Readable code with clear, descriptive names
- **Go Conventions**: Follow effective Go guidelines and use gofmt

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All new code must have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Test command interactions and workflows
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage for critical paths
- **Security Tests**: Test input validation and error handling

### Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits for clear history:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(rituals): add conditional execution based on day of week
fix(config): resolve YAML parsing error with nested arrays
docs(readme): update installation instructions for Windows
test(tracking): add integration tests for time tracking
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Local Development

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature

# Make changes and test
make test
make lint

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): add amazing feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/amazing-feature
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test
go test ./internal/commands -v

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run linting
make lint

# Format code
make fmt
```

## Security Guidelines

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email: security@rune.dev

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Security Best Practices

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Command Execution**: Use secure command execution
- **Credentials**: Store in OS keychain, never in code
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits
- **Permissions**: Principle of least privilege

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

- **Code Comments**: For complex algorithms only
- **API Documentation**: Go doc comments for public APIs
- **User Documentation**: README, command help text
- **Developer Documentation**: Architecture decisions, setup guides

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear and Concise**: Easy to understand
- **Examples**: Include practical examples
- **Up-to-Date**: Keep in sync with code changes
- **Accessible**: Consider screen reader compatibility
